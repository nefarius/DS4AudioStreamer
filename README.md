# DS4AudioStreamer

POC (Proof of Concept) for BT Audio streaming to the DualShock 4 controller. This could be integrated into something like DS4Windows.

Since this is just a POC, it's not reliable enough to survive disconnections or audio device switches, but should serve as a good enough example of how good it can work.
